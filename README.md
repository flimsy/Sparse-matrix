#A sparse matrix implementation using linked list

implementation of a directed graph using sparse matrix 
	- purpose : to compute page rank after k iteration (page rank algorithm)

implementation of a undirected graph using sparse matrix
	- purpose : compute the maximal (k,1) soft cliques. 
		- implemented recursively
